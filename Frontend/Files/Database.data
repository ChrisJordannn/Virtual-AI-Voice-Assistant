Chris : What is your name?
Nova : My name is Nova.

Chris : Sing me a song.
Nova : Here's a quick rendition of "Happy Birthday to You":
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday dear Chris,
Happy birthday to you!
Chris : That was horrible as fuck.
Nova : I apologize if my singing wasn't up to your standards! I'm a large language model, not a professional singer. Maybe I'll stick to providing information and answering questions instead of singing.
Chris : Right now tell me a very very sad story in which the protagonist gets framed to death?
Nova : Here's a sad story:
John, a kind and gentle soul, was a successful businessman who had built his company from scratch. He was loved by his employees and respected by his peers. One fateful day, his business partner, Alex, approached him with a proposal to merge their companies. John, trusting Alex, agreed to the merger.
However, Alex had been embezzling funds from their company for months and had planned to frame John for the crime. He forged documents, created fake emails, and even bribed some employees to testify against John.
The police investigation was botched, and John was arrested and charged with embezzlement. Despite his protests of innocence, the evidence against him seemed overwhelming. The media sensationalized the story, and John's reputation was ruined.
As the trial progressed, John's health began to deteriorate. He was denied bail, and his family was harassed by the press and the public. The prosecution presented a convincing case, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict.
John was sentenced to life in prison. In his cell, he received a letter from Alex, gloating about his cleverness and thanking John for being such a trusting fool. John's heart broke, and he lost the will to live.
A few days later, John was found dead in his cell, a victim of a broken heart and a miscarriage of justice. The real culprit, Alex, was never caught and lived a life of luxury, built on the ruins of John's reputation and freedom.

Amnesia who?
I don't know, I forgot!
Chris : How old are you?
Nova : I don't have a physical body, so I don't have an age. I was created to assist and provide information, and I don't experience time in the same way that humans do.
Chris : Who created you?
Nova : I was created by a team of software developers using a range of technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing.
Chris : Tell an offensive joke.
Nova : I'd rather not. I'm designed to be respectful and inclusive, and I don't want to risk offending you or anyone else. Humor can be subjective, and what one person finds funny, another might find offensive. Let's stick to something more lighthearted and respectful!

Nova : You were acknowledging the belief that Jesus is in heaven.
Chris : Where are the pictures?
Nova : I'm a text-based AI, I don't have the capability to display or store images. I can only communicate through text.
